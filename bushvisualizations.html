<h1>Creating a Memory with Bush's Speech</h1>

<div id="links">
<p>George H.W. Bush continued the gendered rhetoric that shaped the memory of the Vietnam War 
started during Reagan's presidency. In this <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17790&st=vietnam&st1">speech</a>, 
Bush dedicated the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Dallas Texas. The theme of this speech was a 
discussion of how children should remember that Vietnam War as an event in history, as Bush 
noted that half the visitors to Vietnam War memorials were under the age of twelve. This theme 
was significant because it showed that this speech was an example of how the war should be both 
taught and remembered by the public.</p>

<h2>Bush's Word Cloud</h2>

<p>This word cloud shows how veteran sacrifice remains the focus of this speech, and that 
it shapes the historical teachings about the war. Some prominent words featured in the cloud 
are "heroes," "freedom," "memorial," and "honor." Like Reagan, Bush also demonstrates the 
importance of male veterans without giving much discussion about female veterans. Words like 
"men," "boys," and "sons" are relatively large within the cloud, while "women" and "daughters" 
are comparatively small.</p>

<h2>Bush's Word Trees</h2>

<script>
 $(document).ready(function(){
       $('#imgbtree').width(500);
       $('#imgbtree').mouseover(function()
       {
          $(this).css("cursor","pointer");
          $(this).animate({width: "650px"}, 'slow');
       });
    
    $('#imgbtree').mouseout(function()
      {   
          $(this).animate({width: "500px"}, 'slow');
       });
   });
 </script> 

<div id="bushtree">
<img src="HW_Bush_Men.jpg" id="imgbtree">
</div>

<p>The word tree shows how Bush used the word "men" within the context of his speech. As the 
tree demonstrates, the word "women" is only used twice, and both times is used in conjunction 
with the word "men." Again, words that connote veteran sacrifice are tied to Bush's discussion 
of men's relationship to the war. There is still no mention of female veteran's service, which 
was voluntary during the Vietnam War.</p> 

<p>Throughout the speech, Bush calls attention to the 
treatment of veterans upon their return back to the United States. He says that they waged a 
second battle for the hearts and minds of the American people, although they fulfilled their 
call to service. Despite that many men who served in Vietnam did so because of the draft, Bush 
does not discuss the fulfillment of civic duty that female veterans exemplified. Additionally, 
this speech was given during the debates over whether to honor female Vietnam veterans on 
the National Mall in Washington, D.C., showing that although women were trying to have more 
recognition for their service, presidential rhetoric largely ignored this call.</p>
