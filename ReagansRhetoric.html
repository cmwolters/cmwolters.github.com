<h1><a href="http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1984/52884a.htm">Remarks at Memorial Day Ceremonies on May 28,1984</h1></a>

<p>My fellow Americans:
Memorial Day is a day of ceremonies and speeches. Throughout America today, we honor the dead of our wars. 
We recall their valor and their sacrifices. We remember they gave their lives so that others might live.</p>

<p>We're also gathered here for a special event -- the national funeral for an unknown soldier 
who will today join the heroes of three other wars.</p>

<p>When he spoke at a ceremony at Gettysburg in 1863, President Lincoln reminded us that 
through their deeds, the dead had spoken more eloquently for themselves than any of the living 
ever could, and that we living could only honor them by rededicating ourselves to the cause 
for which they so willingly gave a last full measure of devotion.</p>

<p>Well, this is especially so today, for in our minds and hearts is the memory of Vietnam 
and all that that conflict meant for those who sacrificed on the field of battle and for 
their loved ones who suffered here at home...</p>

<p>The Unknown Soldier who is returned to us today and whom we lay to rest is symbolic of 
all our missing sons, and we will present him with the Congressional Medal of Honor, the 
highest military decoration that we can bestow.</p>

<blockquote>About him we may well wonder, as others have: As a child, did he play on some street in 
a great American city? Or did he work beside his father on a farm out in America's heartland? 
Did he marry? Did he have children? Did he look expectantly to return to a bride?</blockquote>

<p>We'll never know the answers to these questions about his life. We do know, though, why 
he died. He saw the horrors of war but bravely faced them, certain his own cause and his 
country's cause was a noble one; that he was fighting for human dignity, for free men everywhere.</p>

<blockquote>Today we pause to embrace him and all who served us so well in a war whose end offered no parades, 
no flags, and so little thanks. We can be worthy of the values and ideals for which our sons 
sacrificed &mdash; worthy of their courage in the face of a fear that few of us will ever 
experience &mdash; by honoring their commitment and devotion to duty and country.</blockquote>

<p>Many veterans of Vietnam still serve in the Armed Forces, work in our offices, on our 
farms, and in our factories. Most have kept their experiences private, but most have been 
strengthened by their call to duty. A grateful nation opens her heart today in gratitude 
for their sacrifice, for their courage, and for their noble service. Let us, if we must, 
debate the lessons learned at some other time. Today, we simply say with pride, "Thank you, 
dear son. May God cradle you in His loving arms."</p>

<p>We present to you our nation's highest award, the Congressional Medal of Honor, for 
service above and beyond the call of duty in action with the enemy during the Vietnam era.</p>


<h1><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=39414&st=vietnam&st1=veteran">Remarks at the Veteran's Day Ceremony on November 11, 1988</h1></a>

<div id="speech">
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, honored guests, my remarks today will be brief because so much has 
been said over the years and said so well about the loyalty and the valor of those who served 
us in Vietnam. It's occurred to me that only one very important thing has been left unsaid, 
and I will try to speak of it today.</p>

<p>It's almost 10 years now since U.S. military involvement in Vietnam came to a close. Two 
years ago, our government dedicated the memorial bearing the names of those who died or are 
still missing. Every day, the families and friends of those brave men and women come to the 
wall and search out a name and touch it...</p>

<p>The fighting men depicted in the statue we dedicate today, the three young American 
servicemen, are individual only in terms of their battle dress; all are as one, with eyes 
fixed upon the memorial bearing the names of their brothers in arms. On their youthful faces, 
faces too young to have experienced war, we see expressions of loneliness and profound love 
and a fierce determination never to forget.</p>

<blockquote>The men of Vietnam answered the call of their country. Some of them died in the arms of 
many of you here today, asking you to look after a newly born child or care for a loved one. 
They died uncomplaining. The tears staining their mud-caked faces were not for self-pity 
but for the sorrow they knew the news of their death would cause their families and friends.</blockquote>

<p>As you knelt alongside his litter and held him one last time, you heard his silent message-
he asked you not to forget.</p>

<p>Today we pay homage not only to those who gave their lives but to their comrades present 
today and all across the country. You didn't forget. You kept the faith. You walked from the 
litter, wiped away your tears, and returned to the battle. You fought on, sustained by one 
another and deaf to the voices of those who didn't comprehend. You performed with a steadfastness 
and valor that veterans of other wars salute, and you are forever in the ranks of that special 
number of Americans in every generation that the Nation records as true patriots...</p>

</div>

<p>And let me say to the Vietnam veterans gathered here today: When you returned home, you 
brought solace to the loved ones of those who fell, but little solace was given to you. Some 
of your countrymen were unable to distinguish between our native distaste for war and the 
stainless patriotism of those who suffered its scars. But there's been a rethinking there, 
too. And now we can say to you, and say as a nation: Thank you for your courage. Thank you 
for being patient with your countrymen. Thank you. Thank you for continuing to stand with 
us together.</p>

<blockquote>The men and women of Vietnam fought for freedom in a place where liberty was in danger. 
They put their lives in danger to help a people in a land far away from their own. Many 
sacrificed their lives in the name of duty, honor, and country. All were patriots who lit 
the world with their fidelity and courage.</blockquote>

<p>They were both our children and our heroes. We will never ever forget them. We will never 
forget their devotion and their sacrifice. They stand before us, marching into time and into 
shared memory, forever. May God bless their souls.</p>

<p>And now I shall sign the document by which this memorial has been gratefully received by
 our government.</p>

<p>And now it belongs to all of us, just as those men who have come back belong to all of us. Thank you.</p>
