<h1>Creating a Memory with Clinton's Speech</h1>

<p>Bill Clinton had a controversial relationship to the Vietnam War. Rather than having served 
like much of his generation, Clinton faced accusations of dodging the draft. As a result, 
Vietnam veterans largely did not originally support Clinton's presidency. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr-_Oi_qHYI">Videos</a> 
of his Memorial Day Speech at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. show this 
relationship, as viewers can audibly hear veterans booing Clinton's speech at The Wall. As 
a result, Clinton does not focus on veteran sacrifice because he is concerned with repairing 
his relationship with Vietnam veterans. Therefore, his 1993 speech cements the historical 
memory of the Vietnam War created by the previous administrations.</p>

<h2>Clinton's Word Cloud</h2>

<p>We can easily see how Clinton takes a look to the future in his speech, moving away from 
the Vietnam War's place in history. "Today" is the largest word represented in the cloud. While 
words related to veteran sacrifice are present in the cloud, apologetic words are larger and 
more visible &mdash; "resolve" and "disagree" are two of the most prominent words in the cloud. 
"Men" and "women" are equally sized in the cloud because instead of noting specific instances 
of veteran sacrifice, like Reagan and Bush commonly did, Clinton generically acknowledges 
the service of all veterans.</p>

<h2>Clinton's Phrases</h2>

<p>The phrase net visualization shows how Clinton's words are separated by spaces within his 
speech. As demonstrated by the word cloud, "today" is one of the most prominently used words, 
and it is connected to words like "America" and "serve." This further differentiates Clinton's 
rhetoric from Bush and Reagan, separating service from veteran sacrifice and tying "America" 
to the present with the word "today."</p>

<p>The shift to Clinton's focus on the future is demonstrated with other phrases used throughout 
his speech at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Relationships between words like "national" and 
"security" or "unity" show an emphasis on his current duties as President of the United States. 
There are not phrases about history, and how to discuss the Vietnam War with other generations, 
but rather only a few phrases that mention that some did serve in Vietnam. Clinton's speech 
is not gendered because he has no reason to make it gendered &mdash; without discussions of 
veteran sacrifice and what occurs during war, there need not be a discussion of women's and men's 
roles in war.</p>
