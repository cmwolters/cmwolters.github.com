		<h2>About this page</h2>
		<p>This page was created for History 697: Creating History in New Media at George 
		Mason University. The class combines the study and analysis of history with the 
		use of digital tools to create a digital history project. This site hosts further 
		content that will be designed in the upcoming months for the course.</p>
		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>I am a Master of Arts candidate with a concentration in American history. My interests
		lie primarily in post-1945 social and cultural history, with an emphasis in the
		Vietnam War. I am also interested in digital history because of the expansion of 
		the field, as well as the feeling that there remains a great deal of uncharted 
		territory, for lack of better term. I hope my time as a graduate student at Mason
		will further develop an understanding for using digital tools in the realm of 
		public history. I also hold a degree in English with a journalism concentration
		from the University of Delaware.</p>
